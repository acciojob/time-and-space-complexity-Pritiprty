  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to execute. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity is relatively low, indicating faster execution. Efficient algorithms are crucial in various applications to ensure optimal performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute, often denoted as O(f(n)), where 'f(n)' represents a function describing the growth rate of space usage. One common notation is O(n), where 'n' is the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> becomes particularly important when dealing with large datasets, and optimizing it ensures efficient memory utilization.
